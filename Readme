# Toy Marketplace - Client-Side

Welcome to the Toy Marketplace client-side repository! This is the front-end part of the Toy Marketplace project, where users can explore and interact with a wide variety of toys.

## Project Description

Toy Marketplace is an online platform that allows users to browse and purchase various toys. The client-side is built using React, providing a user-friendly interface to navigate through different sections of the application.

## Key Features

- **Interactive User Interface**: The client-side of Toy Marketplace offers a visually appealing and intuitive user interface. Users can easily explore different toys, search for specific items, and view details about each toy.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: The application supports user authentication, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and log out. Certain actions, such as adding toys to the marketplace or accessing toy details, require user authentication.

- **Shop by Category**: The "Shop by Category" feature enables users to browse toys based on different categories and sub-categories. This helps users find toys of their interest more efficiently.

- **Add and Manage Toys**: Authenticated users have the ability to add new toys to the marketplace. They can provide details such as toy name, price, quantity, and upload an image. Users can also manage their own toys, edit their details, and delete them if necessary.

- **Responsive Design**: The client-side is built with a responsive design approach, ensuring that the application is accessible and user-friendly across various devices and screen sizes.
